Data point used,Goal ,Reasoning,Refinement Considerations,Why it matters
Date of birth,Finding exact age in number,,,To deduce other more complex data points
Date of birth,Time before next birthday,,,"For the system to consider the upcoming event to suggest a trip. Service, etc in advance"
Date of birth,Probable Life milestones,"People within certain ages tend to have similar expectations, habits and goals based on where they are at a given point in their lives",This is only a baseline and no certainties can be deduced solely on this. ,This helps the system to make hypothesis based on broader demographics and then test them to really capture the person’s current state in life. 
Date of birth,Cultural touchstones based on generational cohort,,,"This is used to better understand someone’s historical context (e.g., a child of the 80s) which will help later when generating hypothesis. "
Date of birth,Legal Adult Status,Check if the person is of legal age and what activities the person could potentially be barred from doing in different countries ,,Will inform on what the user can legally do or not in every country
Date of birth,Finding possible age restrictions to activities or other,"Identifying any possible restrictions either legal or physical based on the person’s age to determine things not suitable for that person e.g taking part in a wine tasting experience for a 10 years old, base jumping for an 85 years old woman, etc. ",,"This informs on what the person can actually do by identifying logical restrictions due to their age. It prevents the system to consider something the person cannot do, but also helps create the right type of trips."
Place of birth,Finding country of birth,,"Must consider the most likely result but, at this point, never consider this deducted datapoint as 100% accurate because several countries can have cities/places with the same name.","To deduce other data points linked to the person’s culture, cultural heritage, language, customs, etc"
Place of birth,Deducing a language the person likely speaks,"Although people could be born somewhere and not speak that country’s language, the probabilities are that the person is more likely than not. ",,"On top of deducing a language the user speaks, this gives also cultural clues as people born in a country and speaking the country’s language usually also have cultural roots linked to that country."
Gender,Finding the most likely pronouns ,,,This helps personalise communication
Email,Place of work by parsing what’s after the “@“ ,Use the email domain to find out where the person works. Discard mainstream domains and consider only proprietary domains,"To prevent false positives, we need to check the email domain against real companies as people can use their own domain without it being linked to any work place.","Finding the person’s place of work is useful to better understand the person and his life. Also, someone using his professional email in aa lifestyle/travel app gives some clues to their personality. Someone using a professional email for Luxel might indicate someone with a more fluid boundary between work and personal and are confortable to have their interest overlapping. It might be the person wants to maintain a certain status, or use a single email for everything, etc. All this are useful clues for our AI"
Email,Digital familiarity. Finding how a person might present themselves,"Using the email handle we can potentially perceive a bit of someone’s personality. Addresses such as “john1985@”, “artlover71@“, etc could indicate how someone chose to present himself online and give clues at possible interests or more",,"This is about finding personality clues in the person’s email handle. This of course is never a certainty because often use the same email for years despite changing as persons. However, this gives interesting clues we need to analyse so we can then use the results as parts of our hypothesis to find new clues that lead to more certain data points. "
Phone number,Finding the country linked with the phone,Use the country code to determine the country of the phone. This will indicate possible connections with that country if the country is different from where the user resides (place of residence),"A person can life somewhere and use a number from a different country so this data point canot be treated as final. It simply gives more clues. People in this situation usually have international lifestyles and have a real link with the other country, which is a valuable new data point. ","If the country code matches with the city of residence, it is useful to confirm the country of residence (there no countries with multiple cities/towns with the same name. If so, the user will be used to also writing the initials of the region or state. If it doesn’t match, it says the person has ties with a different country which is something really interesting"
City of residence,Finding the country of residence,,"Must consider the most likely result but, at this point, never consider this deducted datapoint as 100% accurate because several countries can have cities/places with the same name.",To deduce other more complex data points
City of residence,Deducing a language the person likely speaks based of the country of residence,,"Most of the times, people living in a country speak or learn that country’s language. However, this is not a certainty. ",Helps understand the person and personalise trips
City of residence,Finding the person’s present day environment,"Clues about the settings of their day-to-day life such as urban/rural, coastal/inland, climate, local community, etc",,"Each city/town or type of place has a certain yet brad style of life. Although someone might life somewhere for many reasons, the environment where they life has influences on their lives. Someone living in a small costal town in a warm region lives differently than someone living in downtown Manhattan NYC. This matters to understand the person’s broad way of life. "
City of residence,,"Clues about the style and pace of life in that specific place of residence, e.g, fast paced life, quiet life, etc",,"Knowing the pace and style of life in the place where someone lives informs, up to a certain degree, how they enjoy their lives, therefore their trips. Someone living in a quiet place is less likely to enjoy a fast paced city trip, but someone living in a busy city is likely to enjoy taking a break and have time to relax when traveling. "
Email + Full name,Professional vs personal email,"If someone’s email contains a proprietary name domain + the full name or partial name of the person, it means it is a professional email. If the email is a generic word such as contact, director, etc, it means also it’s a professional email",,Helps get clues informing about the person’s personality.
Email + Age,Possible tech savvy person,Tech savvy people and early adopters are usually younger and sometimes use less common or custom domains. A decades-old “AOL” address might indicate a different generation of internet usage,"As some people simply prefer mainstream email providers only for convenience, this cannot be treated as a certainty. ","As people of any age can be tech savvy and/or early adopters, this will give a clue as to the personality of the person. The data obtained here can be used to test hypnotises. "
Place of birth + city of residence,How rooted is the person in the city he currently lives in,"If someone was born somewhere and, years later is still living in the same place it means the person will have strong roots. If the person moved within a country (or region) it means there’s still many roots but it won’t be the same as living in the same city. ",,"Gives important information about culture, cultural heritage, attachment to places, etc. "
Place of birth + city of residence,Possible relocation which could mean personal attaches to city of birth if not the same as city of residence. ,If someone was born somewhere and then moved countries this means they might have cultural or even family attaches in their home city/country. ,"If place of birth and city of residence are not the same, this cannot be over interpreted because we don’t know why the person relocated, since when or for how long. We only know it is someone that has high probabilities of having relocated","Knowing someone has roots somewhere helps create hypothesis that have to be tested. Does the person like to eat cuisine of his home country, does he likes to travel back home often, etc. "
Place of birth + country of residence (deduced datapoint),Finding possible cultural roots,"Someone born in a country usually develop cultural roots from that culture and this follows the person throughout his life, even when he relocates into a country with a different culture.",,"This gives broader information about cultural heritage, etc."
City of Residence + age,Decide the person’s broad living style based on age and milestone,Someone in their 20’s living in a big city vs someone in his 70’s living in a small costal town have completely different living styles ,"This must be treated as a baseline, not a definitive result. Even if this points toward certain types of lives, it is only a broad approximation. ",This gives information about the possible lifestyle of the person. Although this is obviously a broad generalisation it serves as baseline to then test hypothesis. A 23 years old living in Oxford is surely studying at Oxford university and has the life of an Oxford university student.
Date of birth + Gender + city of residence,Understand possible preferences based on target demographic segment,People of a certain age and gender in a specific place tend to have similarities,"Although there are similarities this is not a certainty, simply a starting point. ",By combining these 3 datapoints we get a more granular picture of what similar people like/do. This can be used as baseline to start building hypothesis

DATA AUGMENTATION USING LOGIC FROM THE GIVEN DATA POINTS + THE NEWLY AQUIRE DATAPOINTS.,,,,
Place of Birth + City of residence + age + probable milestones + present day environment,Obtaining clues as to the type of life the person might have.,"Instead of searching a specific data point, here we try to understand the person’s “life narrative” by painting a sort of multi-dimensional baseline ",,"This will help get clues to assess the person’s personality, lifestyle and expectations. "
Age + email + gender,Finding clues at the person’s private vs public self-expression,"Extroverted or playful people, especially of certain ages, may reveal personal interests or personality traits in their email handle. A handle identical to their real name might mean they prefer a more straightforward, professional, or private approach.","As an email handle is sometimes an ancient legacy choice, this cannot be treated as certainty because it may not reflect current personality",
Country of Birth + Country of residence + phone number,Possible persistence and attachment to origines information,"If someone born in a country is living in a different country but has a phone number of his country of birth, it may mean strong cultural bods and other things. ",,"This can open many hypothesis that will help understand the person’s personality and current life. There are many reasons as to why someone could have a number from his birth country although the person lives somewhere else, and each possibility points toward different personality traits. This is why it’s important to have this data point. "
Place of work (from email) + age,Knowing the person’s industry and possible seniority,"If the email is professional, it is possible to deduce the industry of the company the person works for. Combined with his age gives a clue to his seniority in the company and in work in general. ",,
